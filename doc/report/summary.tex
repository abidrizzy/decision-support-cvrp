\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summ}

Although the objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the 
proposed ICN traffic classifiers, rather than the performance of a particular 
ICN architecture and\slash or stack (which may lead the reader to question how 
does this topic fit in a computer networks course...), the long term goal is to 
lay the grounds for future research on ICNs, which can be seen as a subset of 
evolutionary Future Internet Architectures (FIA) research.\vertbreak

(...) using Machine Learning-based traffic classification 
methods for (...) can be applied to (1) adoption (2) enhancement of probabilistic in-network caching 
policies based on ~\cite{Psaras2012,Chai2013} and even (3) more `educated' named-based 
routing decisions.
