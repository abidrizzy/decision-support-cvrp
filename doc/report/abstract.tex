The objective of this work is to gain hands-on understanding of several 
heuristics and metaheuristics, essencial tools for problem solving with 
application in a multitude of research areas in science and engineering. As a case study, we consider the 
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) -- an important subject in the areas of 
Operations Research related with physical distribution and logistics -- applying constructive 
heuristics, local search procedures and metaheuristics and comparing the 
provided solutions. This work describes the implementation of both parallel and 
sequential versions of the Clarke and Wright Savings (CWS) algorithm (a clearly 
constructive heuristic), several local search heuristics (2-opt and 
1-interchange), as well as custom versions of the Simulated Annealing (SA) 
algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as examples of metaheuristics. The 
provided implementations are tested against several datasets.

%We expect to lay the groundwork for the application of the 
%proposed classification techniques to several areas such as (1) 
%adaptation of ICN nodes to new traffic types, (2) automated application of QoS 
%schemes within the ICN scope, (3) Lawful Inspection 
%(LI), (4) integration within OOPDAL loops, etc.
