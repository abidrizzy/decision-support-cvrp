\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

The main objectives of this work are the following:\vertbreak

\textbf{1)} To understand the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and 
            identify appropriate constructive heuristics to tackle the 
            problem.\vertbreak

\textbf{2)} Implement the parallel and sequential versions of the Clarke and 
            Wright Savings (CWS) algorithm, one of the most widely known heuristics 
            (in fact a constructive heuristic) for tackling the CVRP.\vertbreak

\textbf{3)} Plan and implement a local search routine to enhance the sub-optimal 
            output of the CWS constructive heuristic.\vertbreak

\textbf{4)} Plan and implement two metaheuristics for the CVRP: (1) a Simulated 
            Annealing (SA) approach and (2) a Genetic Algorithm.\vertbreak

\textbf{5)} Run the proposed implementations against several datasets, 
            documenting the obtained results. For each dataset, compare and discuss the 
            results of (1) parallel version of the CWS, (2) sequential version 
            of the CWS, (3) eventual enhancements provided by the implemented 
            local search routine, (4) behavior of the metaheuristics according to 
            different parameters. These different results should be 
            compared against the optimal solution, provided in the list of 
            datasets to be applied~\cite{website:cvrp-datasets}.\vertbreak
