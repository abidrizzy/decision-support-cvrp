The SA approach used in this work follows that proposed by Osman 
in~\cite{Osman1993}, also described in Section 6.2.2 of~\cite{Toth2002}. It 
introduces several differences to the basic SA algorithms, specifically: 

\begin{itemize}

    \item A procedure for an initial calibration of the `temperature' values 
            and the `cooling' ratio; 
    \item A non-monotonic cooling schedule which includes occasional 
            temperature increments, among the more frequent temperature 
            decrements;
    \item A $\lambda$-interchange mechanism~\cite{Osman1993} for building up solution 
            neighborhoods, which basically consists in (i) \textit{shift 
            operations} (i.e. taking a node $i$ from route $r_k$ and inserting 
            it in another route $r_l$), and \textit{interchange operations} 
            (taking a node $i$ from $r_k$ and inserting it in $r_l$, while also 
            shifting node $j$ from $r_l$ into $r_k$).

While the $\lambda$ in the $\lambda$-interchange mechanism may assume any 
positive integer value (...) most implementations use $\lambda \le 2$.\vertbreak

\subsubsection{Osman's Hybrid SA\slash TS Algorithm}
\label{subsec:osman-sa-algorithm}

(...) as described in~\cite{Osman1993}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{STEP 1:} Generate an initial solution $S$ by 
            applying the CWS algorithm (constructive heuristic).
    \item \textbf{STEP 2.1:} Initialize the temperature and cooling schedule 
            parameters by running a test search over the entire neighborhood 
            of $S$, generated by a 1-interchange mechanism. During this test 
            search, one should not perform any exchanges, only take note of the 
            largest and smallest absolute changes in the total route distances 
            --- $\Delta_{max}$ and $\Delta_{min}$ --- as well as the total number of 
            feasible changes $\beta$ (i.e. those which do not violate capacity 
            constraints).
    \item \textbf{STEP 2.2:} Set (1) the starting temperature $T_s = \Delta_max$; 
            (2) the final temperature $T_f = \Delta_{min}$; (3) the reset temperature 
            $T_r = T_s$; (4) $\alpha = N \times \beta$\footnote{$N$ being the 
            number of demand points for the CVRP instance.}; (5) $\gamma = N$;
            (6) the reset limit (stopping criterion) $R = 3$; and (7) the 
            (first) best solution $S_b = S$.
    \item \textbf{STEP 3:} Select a solution $S'$ among the neighborhood of 
            $S$, generated by a 1-interchange mechanism, executing operations in 
            the order (0,1) (1,0) (1,1)\footnote{Our approach will apply a First 
            Improvement (FI) strategy.}. Compute the change in 
            the total distance produced by $S'$, i.e. $\Delta = c(S') - c(S)$.
    \item \textbf{STEP 4:} Given the change value $\Delta$, perform the usual 
            SA set of conditional statements and procedures:
\end{itemize}\vertbreak

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\If {$\Delta \le 0$}
    \State $S' \leftarrow$ 2-OPT($S'$)
    \State $S \leftarrow S'$
    \If {$c(S') < c(S_b)$}
        \State $S_b \leftarrow S'$
        \State $T_b \leftarrow T_k$
    \EndIf
\Else 
    \If {$\theta \in [0,1[ \le e^{\frac{-\Delta}{T_k}}$}
        \State $S \leftarrow S'$
    \EndIf
\EndIf
\end{algorithmic}\vertbreak

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{STEP 5:} Update the temperatures following one of two possible 
            rules:
\end{itemize}\vertbreak

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\If {$S$ not updated after STEP 4}
    \State $T_r = $ max$\left\{\frac{T_r}{2},T_b\right\}$
    \State $T_k = T_r$
    \State $R \leftarrow R - 1$
\Else 
    \State $T_k = \frac{T_k}{(1 + \beta_kT_k)}$, with $\beta_k = \frac{T_s - T_f}{(\alpha + \gamma \sqrt{k}T_sT_f)}$
\EndIf
\State $k \leftarrow k + 1$
\end{algorithmic}\vertbreak

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{STEP 6:} Stop if $R = 0$ (i.e. $R$ resets were made after 
            $S_b$ was found), otherwise go to \textbf{STEP 3}.
\end{itemize}
